# Show-BPIndex

Want to know where a score ranks among your best plays? By using this script, you can easily find out the position of a score in your best plays list.

This project is a simple TamperMonkey script that enhances the [osu! website](osu.ppy.sh) by adding a feature to display the index of your best plays in the leaderboard.
